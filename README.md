# condo_ds_project 
for interview

the web app link can be found in the first line of my resume

# The project includes

1. condo price prediction: use XGB regressor to predict condo price 
2. condo cluster: Use partitioning clustering Kmeans algorithm that gathers and groups Toronto condos into 7 number of clusters and provide the ideal suggestion for people to choose condo location via clustering analysis
3. top ranked condos: Present top condos after ranking from customized
multi-criteria via statistics models: MOORA and TOPSIS
4. chatbot: use NLP and tensorflow to build chatbot app
